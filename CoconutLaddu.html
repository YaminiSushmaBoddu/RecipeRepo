    <h1>coconut laddu</h1>
    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1.5 cups of tightly packed fresh grated coconut</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ghee</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon green cardamom powder</li>
        <li>½ can of sweetened condensed milk – 220 grams</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh grated coconut or unsweetened desiccated coconut</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of ghee in a frying pan or kadai. You can also use coconut oil instead of ghee.</li>
        <li>Add 1.5 cups of tightly packed grated coconut.</li>
        <li>Stir and sauté the coconut on low heat for 3 to 4 minutes but make sure they don’t brown. Roasting gets rid of the excess moisture.</li>
    <li>Now add ¾ cup of sweetened condensed milk.Add ½ teaspoon of green cardamom powder.</li>
    <li>Mix well and cook the mixture on a low heat.The mixture should begin to thicken. Keep stirring regularly.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture has cooled completely, pinch medium balls from the mixture and form ladoo.
 Rub ghee on the palm of your hands and shape the coconut ladoo. If the mixture is loose then you won’t be able to make the ladoo.</li>
    </ul>
