   <h1>badam halwa</h1>
   <h2>Ingredients:</h2> 
   <ol>
    <li>1.25 cups almond flour (blanched) </li>
    <li>1/3 cup sugar </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
    <li>a big pinch saffron</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk - to soak saffron</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk - to add while making halwa</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder - can add little more if you like</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Instructions:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>First, soak a big pinch of saffron in 1/4 cup milk. You can use full-fat milk or skimmed milk, I used 1.5% fat milk.</li>
    <li>Set this aside. Milk will turn yellow and fragrant as saffron releases its color and flavor.</li>
    <li>Take a thick bottom deep pan, and heat it in low heat. Make sure to take a thick bottom deep pan in order to avoid burning and spluttering of the badam halwa mixture.</li>
    <li>Then add 2 tablespoon ghee, and let it melt</li>
    <li>Once it is melted, add 1.25 cups (125 grams) almond flour. Mix it well with ghee.</li>
    <li>Next, add in 1/2 cup milk, and mix the almond flour well with milk. Let this cook in low heat for about 2 minutes so that the almond flour absorbs the milk well.</li>
    <li>Then add in 1/3 cup sugar and mix well. 1/3 cup is little less than 1/2 cup and little more than 1/4 cup. You can adjust the quantity as per your taste.</li>
    <li>Now add the saffron soaked milk along with the saffron strands.</li>
    <li>At this stage, the mixture will be liquidy because of milk and sugar. Start stirring the mixture in low-medium heat such that it gets thicker.
    </li>
    <li>Once it starts getting thicker, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and keep stirring.</li>
    <li>After about 8 minutes or so, the mixture will start becoming a mass. At this stage, add 1 more tablespoon of ghee.
    </li>
    <li>In about 3-4 minutes, the mixture will start leaving the pan. This is the sign that it is cooked and in the right consistency. Do not overcook as halwa will become chewy.
    </li>
    <li>Remember, badam halwa gets a little thicker as it cools. So do not overcook as it will otherwise get chewy later.</li>
    <li>So once it is of the right consistency, immediately transfer to a plate or a bowl.</li>
    <li>Serve the halwa warm or after it comes down to room temperature.</li>
   </ul>
