    <h1>vermicelli kheer</h1>
    <h2>ingredients:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 tablespoon Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>3 cloves – optional</li>
        <li>1 cup seviyan (broken vermicelli or semiya)</li>
        <li>1 litre whole milk or 4 cups milk</li>
        <li>7 to 8 tablespoons sugar – add more or less for your preferred sweetness</li>
        <li>▢½ teaspoon cardamom powder (ground cardamom)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon almond slivers or almond slices</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped cashews – chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>4 to 5 dried rose petals – optional</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon golden raisins</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce the flame to its lowest and slowly pour milk in the pan. Mix very well.</li>
        <li>Simmer milk on a low to medium-low heat. Stir ocassionally so that the milk or seviyan does not stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the milk come to a boil on a low to medium-low heat. Once the milk comes to a boil, then add 7 to 8 tablespoons sugar or as per taste. </li>
        <li>Mix very well so that all the sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Next add 1 tablespoons of sliced almonds and 1 tablespoon chopped cashews. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Then add ½ teaspoon cardamom powder.
            Also add 4 to 5 dried rose petals. This step is optional. Skip if you do not have dried rose petals. </li>
            <li>Cook the vermicelli kheer mixture for 4 to 5 minutes more till the seviyan gets cooked and the milk thickens. When the seviyan has softened and cooked well, the kheer will also thicken and look creamy.</li>
            <li>Switch off heat and then 1 tablespoons of golden raisins. Mix again. Check the taste of semiya kheer and if required you can add some more sugar.
            </li>
            <li>Serve the seviyan kheer hot, warm or chilled. You can garnish with some chopped nuts or dried rose petals while serving. Do note that on cooling the kheer will thicken.</li>
    </ul>
