<h1>besan halwa</h1>
<h2>ingridents:</h2>
<body>
    <ol>
    <li>1 cup ghee</li>
    <li>1.5 cup chickpea flour (besan)</li>
    <li>2 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
    <li>Almond and pistachio slivers for garnishing</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add ½ cup ghee in a heavy bottom pan.</li>
        <li>Once the ghee is melted, add ¾ cup chickpea flour and fry on medium heat until browned and a nutty aroma starts to come from it. It will take 10-12 minutes. Keep stirring continuously to avoid the flour from burning at the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>The color of the final halwa will depend on how well you have roasted the flour. You want the flour to be dark brown in color but not burn it. It goes from perfectly browned to burnt in a few seconds. So keep a close eye while roasting it.</li>
        <li>Once the chickpea flour is browned well, add 1 cup water and ½ cup milk to the pan and cook until the liquid is absorbed by the flour. Keep stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cardamom powder to the pan. Mix well and cook for 5-6 minutes on low heat until ghee starts to separate from the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Once done, garnish with almond and pistachio slivers and serve hot.</li>
    </ul>
